# drugs-free

<b>live website: [dlmpires/drugs-free](https://dlmpires.github.io/drugs-free/)</b><br>
DrugsFree was a school project created by dlmpires and gmsgarcia to educate users about drugs and advocate safe practices.

# Overview

This is a static website focused on the frontend, with the objective of giving the user a smooth experience.
No backend was added as this was a school project, and we did what was asked :)

Although we wanted the website to be in English, we had to code it in Portuguese.
The website doesn't use any framework like React, Angular, or Vue; it was coded in the old-fashioned way!
